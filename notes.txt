interactive twitch bot
    reads chat commands and translates them into in-game actions in Minecraft - done
    provides useful feedback based on the success and the effects of the commands
        Minecraft chat feedback - done
        Twitch chat feedback - done

commands will be categorized into 4 groups (what exactly does this mean?)
    movement (forward, backward, left, right, jump) - needs testing
    interaction (mine, place, craft, use items)
        mine - needs refactoring
        place - done
        craft - needs testing
        use items - done
        combat (attack, block, run, equip armor) - needs testing
        voting commands (where to explore next, what to build)
            todo:
                !lookforstructure <structure> - votes to look for the specified structure. Uses /locate internally and walks in the general direction of the nearest structure to make experience less boring.
                !lookforbiome <biome> - votes to look for the specified biome.
                !buildhouse - votes for building a house.
                !buildnetherportal - votes for building a nether portal.
                !fillendportalframe - If within 8 blocks of an end portal frame block, detect if end portal frame is valid, then if the player has enough eyes, then finally actually use the eyes to light the portal

goals - todo
    note: probably best to use an advancement for goals that don't have advancements.
        for structure detection, take a look at the nether portal and end portal frame code?
    build a house
    build a nether portal - advancement (we need to go deeper?)
    fill an end portal frame with ender eyes - advancement (the end??)
    explore all biomes - advancement (adventuring time)
    kill the ender dragon - advancement (the end.?)
